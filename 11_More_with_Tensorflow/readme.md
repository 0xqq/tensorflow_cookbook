## [Ch 11: More with Tensorflow](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/11_More_with_Tensorflow)

 1. [Visualizing Computational Graphs (with Tensorboard)](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/11_More_with_Tensorflow/01_Visualizing_Computational_Graphs)
  * An example of using histograms, scalar summaries, and creating images in Tensorboard.
 2. [Clustering Using K-means](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/11_More_with_Tensorflow/02_Working_with_a_Genetic_Algorithm)
  * How to use Tensorflow to do k-means clustering.  We use the Iris data set, set k=3, and use k-means to make predictions.
 3. [Working with a Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/11_More_with_Tensorflow/03_Clustering_Using_KMeans)
  * We create a genetic algorithm to optimize an individual (array of 50 numbers) toward the ground truth function.
 4. [Solving a System of ODEs](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/11_More_with_Tensorflow/04_Solving_A_System_of_ODEs)
  * Here, we show how to use Tensorflow to solve a system of ODEs.  The system of concern is the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system.
