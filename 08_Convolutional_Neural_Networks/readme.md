## [Ch 8: Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/08_Convolutional_Nerual_Networks)

 1. [Introduction](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/08_Convolutional_Neural_Networks/01_Introduction)
  * We introduce convolutional neural networks (CNN), and how we can use them in Tensorflow.
 2. Implementing a Simple CNN.
  * Here, we show how to create a CNN architecture that performs well on the MNIST digit recognition task.
 3. Implementing an Advanced CNN.
  * In this example, we show how to replicate an architecture for the CIFAR-10 image recognition task.
 4. Retraining an Existing Architecture.
 5. Using Stylenet/NeuralStyle.
 6. Implementing Deep Dream.
