## [Ch 8: Convolutional Neural Networks](#ch-8-convolutional-neural-networks)

 1. [Introduction](01_Intro_to_CNN)
  * We introduce convolutional neural networks (CNN), and how we can use them in TensorFlow.
 2. [Implementing a Simple CNN.](02_Intro_to_CNN_MNIST)
  * Here, we show how to create a CNN architecture that performs well on the MNIST digit recognition task.
 3. [Implementing an Advanced CNN.](03_CNN_CIFAR10)
  * In this example, we show how to replicate an architecture for the CIFAR-10 image recognition task.
 4. [Retraining an Existing Architecture.](04_Retraining_Current_Architectures)
  * We show how to download and setup the CIFAR-10 data for the [TensorFlow retraining/fine-tuning tutorial.](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/inception)
 5. [Using Stylenet/NeuralStyle.](05_Stylenet_NeuralStyle)
  * In this recipe, we show a basic implementation of using Stylenet or Neuralstyle.
 6. [Implementing Deep Dream.](06_Deepdream)
  * This script shows a line-by-line explanation of TensorFlow's deepdream tutorial. Taken from [Deepdream on TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/deepdream). Note that the code here is converted to Python 3.
