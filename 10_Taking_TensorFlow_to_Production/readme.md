## [Ch 10:Taking TensorFlow to Production](#ch-10-taking-tensorflow-to-production)

 1. [Implementing Unit Tests](01_Implementing_Unit_Tests)
  * We show how to implement different types of unit tests on tensors (placeholders and variables).
 2. [Using Multiple Executors (Devices)](02_Using_Multiple_Devices)
  * How to use a machine with multiple devices.  E.g., a machine with a CPU, and one or more GPUs.
 3. [Parallelizing TensorFlow](03_Parallelizing_TensorFlow)
  * How to setup and use TensorFlow distributed on multiple machines.
 4. [Tips for TensorFlow in Production](04_Production_Tips)
  * Various tips for devloping with TensorFlow
 5. [An Example of Productionalizing TensorFlow](05_Production_Example)
  * We show how to do take the RNN model for predicting ham/spam (from Chapter 9, recipe #2) and put it in two production level files: training and evaluation.
