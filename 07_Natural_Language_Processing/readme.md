 1. [Introduction](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/07_Natural_Language_Processing/01_Introduction)
  * Here we use Tensorflow to do a one-hot-encoding of words called bag-of-words.  We use this method and logistic regression to predict if a text message is spam or ham.
 2. [Working with Bag-of-Words](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/07_Natural_Language_Processing/02_Working_with_Bag_of_Words)
  * Here we use Tensorflow to do a one-hot-encoding of words called bag-of-words.  We use this method and logistic regression to predict if a text message is spam or ham.
 3. [Implementing TF-IDF](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/tree/master/07_Natural_Language_Processing/03_Implementing_tf_idf)
  * We implement Text Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) with a combination of Sci-kit Learn and Tensorflow. We perform logistic regression on TFIDF vectors to improve on our spam/ham text-message predictions.
